  ## Installation
  This can be run from any CLI you prefer. This requires, node.js, npm utils, inquirer, and jest at minimum to run the app as well as run the tests. If you chose to remove the noted code, and run that you will need canvas. Install node.js, then NPM, and input (npm i inquirer@8.2.4) and (npm i jest). This app uses a specific version of inquirer for now. 
  
  ## Usage
  Inside your prefered code editor, enter (node index.js). You will be prompted a series of questions. Input the answers following the on screen instructions.
